# Learning Python üêç

After a long time, I finally decided to learn Python. This is because I want to try out some Flask and Django and see what they have to offer. I am following a free [9-hour course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAFL1597eM) on YouTube. Feel free to try it out yourself.

 ## Getting Started

 First, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then chosoe a project you want to try and run the following:

 ```
 py <file_name>
 ```
